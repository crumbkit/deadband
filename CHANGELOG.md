# Changelog

This file records the notable changes to deadband. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and deadband
follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- `DEADBAND_HELD=0` no longer marks a job as held, and `DEADBAND_HELD` and
  `DEADBAND_BYPASS` now read their values by the same rule: a variable takes
  effect when it is set to a value that is neither empty nor `0`.
